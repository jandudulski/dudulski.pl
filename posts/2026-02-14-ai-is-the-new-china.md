Two thoughts from this week

1. Understanding of good code/architecture will now be evaluated by how well AI can pick it up.
2. AI is the new China. Cheap mass production and making it easy to throw away always displace tailored production. Security issues? Nothing new, just think about toys that are eventually banned from the EU market as dangerous for toddlers, materials that should never get in contact with food, things that are broken on first contact, etc.

Which reassures me that [Event Modeling](https://eventmodeling.org/) with [Vertical Slices](https://www.jimmybogard.com/vertical-slice-architecture/) is a perfect choice for years to come:

* optimized to parallelize and automate the work
* optimized to throw away parts that are broken or don't fit the needs
* quality of a part (slice) is less of a problem as they are easy to replace or recreate
* slices are limited to just two standardized types which makes them easy to roll for mass production
* it's easier to stop chasing opus magnum quality in every single place
* at the same time, chasing for quality in one part will not slow down others as they are fully decoupled

Actually, that's actually more than two thoughts, but AI can't count and nobody cares.
